# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to .env
# 2. Fill in your Azure OpenAI service details
# 3. The notebook will automatically load these values
# 4. Without these values, the process framework will still demonstrate 
#    the core workflow concepts, but AI-powered steps will show errors

# Note: Keep your .env file private and never commit it to version control!
